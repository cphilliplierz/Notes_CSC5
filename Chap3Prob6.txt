 * Created on July 2, 2014, 1:23 PM
 * How Many Widgets?
 * The Yukon Widget Company manufactures widgets that weigh 9.2 pounds each.
 * Write a program that calculates how many widgets are stacked on a pallet, based on
 * the total weight of the pallet. The program should ask the user how much the pallet
 * weighs by itself and with the widgets stacked on it. It should then calculate and display
 * the number of widgets stacked on the pallet.
